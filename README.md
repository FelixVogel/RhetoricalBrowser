RhetoricalBrowser
=====

RhetoricalBrowser is an internet browser that I am creating using JavaFx. I plan to add features to it to improve my skills in Java.

Some of the features I plan to add include are:
* Home button
* Back and forward button
* Refresh button
* Bookmarks bar (loaded from a JSON file, likely)
* Some other items as I come across them and decide I'd like to work on it.
