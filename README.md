RhetoricalBrowser
=====

RhetoricalBrowser is an internet browser that I am creating using JavaFx. I plan to add features to it to improve my skills in Java.

Some of the features I plan to add include are:\n
[x] Home button\n
[x] Back and forward button\n
[x] Refresh button\n
[] Bookmarks bar (loaded from a JSON file, likely)\n
#[] Some other items as I come across them and decide I'd like to work on it.\n
